# data_science_assignment

Just three things to do->

1). Keep the code and dataset in the same folder.
2). Be in that folder while using terminal.
3). Run "python main.py"

if you need to try it on some other data, you need to rename that file to dataset.csv and keep it in the same folder as that of the code

THANK YOU :)
